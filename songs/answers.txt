If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

I can characterize a listener's audio aura by looking at certain aspect of the songs they listen to. If average values of energy and other factos are high, I could conclude that the listener's aura might be energatic and the opposite if the average is low.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

It could not be very representative because we are basing it off of only a few metrics.
